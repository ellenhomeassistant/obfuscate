# TIS Integration

This repository contains the TIS integration for Home Assistant. The integration allows you to control and monitor TIS devices through Home Assistant.

## Obfuscation

The `obfuscate.py` script is used to obfuscate the Python files in the `tis_integration_original` directory.
The obfuscated files are saved in the `tis_integration` directory.

To run the obfuscation script, use the following command:

```sh
python obfuscate.py
```
